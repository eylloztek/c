- a function that returns a vector
- a function that creates a random vector
- a function that returns a matrix
- a function that creates a random matrix
- a function that return the space we took from the memory to the system
- a function that calculates mean
- a function that calculates correlation
- a function that calculates covariance
- a function that calculates the multiplication of a matrix
- a function that calculates the transpose of a matrix
- a function that calculates the row means
- a function that calculates the column means
- a function that calculates the covariance of a matrix
- a function that calculates the determinant of a matrix
- a function that prints the vector
- a function that prints the matrix
